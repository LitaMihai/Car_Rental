# Car_Rental

This is an application for car rentals. The app is in development and I work on it just to learn. It is not intended for online publication.

Programming Languages used:
  - C/C++

The others programming languages that appers on project main page come from libraries.

Libraries used:
  - SFML
  - cURL
  - MySQL
  - nlohmann/JSON

To build and run this code you need to download MySQL Connector/C++ and MySQL Server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.
After that, in project settings, set the 4 directories path (both includes and libs).

The others libraries are already functionally.

The application is not the best in terms of memory or running time, but I used various ideas to learn as much as possible.
